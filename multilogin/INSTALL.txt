SETTINGS
==============
Each plugin has it`s own instructions  at admin/settings/multilogin
General settings are:
* Fast registration mode
	when user is going to register via social network it can be done two ways
	- first, usual, as openid module does - user is being registered only if external system provides enough information - usually it`s email adress and login. If there are not email or login presented, user is being redirected to registration form/
	- Fast registration mode - user is being registered using external authentication anyway. If external system provides not enough information, some registration form fields left blank.
	You can implement hook_multilogin_create_user() (see README.txt) to manage how user info is managed.
* Role for users without email
	if user is registered in   Fast registration mode, their email can be not presented. To filter such users you can add them a role
